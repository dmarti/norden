# Norden: remove recommended videos from YouTube

Simple browser extension to remove YouTube
recommendations and prevent auto-play of next video.

Google either can't or won't moderate those features.

This is so that you can send your family a link to
one video hosted on YouTube without them getting
sucked into a rat hole of white power bullshit.
